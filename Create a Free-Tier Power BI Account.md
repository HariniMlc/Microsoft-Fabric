4. Click **No, thanks** in the "Automatically sign in to Microsoft sites like Bing and Outlook."

## Activate a Fabric Trial

1. After signing up for a free Power BI account, in the Power BI portal at [Microsoft Fabric](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com), select the **Account Manager** icon (the user image at the top right) and in the menu, select **Free trial** to start a Microsoft Fabric trial.
2. Click **Activate**.
3. You should see a "Successfully upgraded to Microsoft Fabric" dialog. Select **Stay on current page**.

After the trial has been started, you can close the browser. Just remember the email and password you used to sign up for Power BI - you'll need them in the exercise.
